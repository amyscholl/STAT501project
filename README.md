STAT 501 Fall 2022 Final Project

The dataset includes 545 records of house prices and their qualities from the mid 1970’s. 
Qualities include house area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, stories, whether it is on a 
main road, if there is a basement, hot water heater, and/or air conditioning, how many parking 
spots, if it is in a “preferred area”, and if it is furnished. Together, these qualities attribute to 
twelve total predictor variables in the dataset (five numeric, seven categorical). House area, 
bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking are numeric, predictor variables. Variables main road, 
guest room, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, and preferred area have yes/no 
responses. The furnishing status predictor variable has three responses: furnished, semi-
furnished, and unfurnished. The response variable is housing price in U.S. dollars.  

Using this dataset, we aim to answer three questions. First, which house quality had the greatest 
influence on housing price? Second, is there a combination of variables that result in the highest 
housing prices? Last, would houses listed as being in an “unpreferred area” be priced differently 
if they were in a preferred area? After answering these questions, we will have a more holistic 
understanding of house qualities’ impacts on housing prices during the mid 1970’s.
